These short clips (`that-is-so-fetch.gif` and

[**Mean Girls**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Girls). They can be found on

This clip (`you-think-you-can-stop-me.gif`) of the iconic
[**Darth Sidious**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/characters/nm0001519)
is from 2005's
[Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_III_%E2%80%93_Revenge_of_the_Sith).
(**Note:** The line in the film is actually **"You will not stop me"**, but the
misquote in this GIF is more fitting for how TaterBot uses it.)

**Tato** is the mascot of the [**Lost in Potato**](https://discord.gg/tato)
Discord server. This particular image (`potato-purple-heart.png`) is just one of
the hundreds of adorable potato-themed emotes that can be found in there. All
credit goes to Tato's very talented artist and server owner, **Aimi**!
